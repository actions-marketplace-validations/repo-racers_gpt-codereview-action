<summary>How It Works</summary>


1. **Choose Our Fork:** Instead of referencing popular GitHub Actions repositories directly, simply reference this repository in your workflow.
   
2. **Enjoy Dedicated Support:** If you encounter any issues or need assistance, reach out to us on our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1229786735161118882/1229786735161118885) server. Our team will be happy to help you promptly.

4. **Contribute to the Community:** Rest assured that when we fix issues in our forks, we contribute back to the original repositories, benefiting the entire open-source community.

*Not Your Thing?*

We don't want to get in between you and the community. If you want to handle forking and submitting a pull request yourself, that's awesome.

However, feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1229786735161118882/1229786735161118885) anyway if you need any help and advice in doing so.
